We have a spaceship. It consists of various modules that improve the characteristics of the ship. The ship has base HP and a shield, the shield regenerates over time.
It is necessary to make a simple prototype, where there will be two ships on the screen, you can select modules for both ships and start the battle. The victory criterion is the death of one of the ships.
